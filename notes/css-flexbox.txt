1. Flexbox stacks html elements on main axis and cross axis. By default the elements are aligned on the main axis, and the main axis is horizontal.
To make the main axis as vertical, add a property flex-direction: column.

2. To align container elements,

.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center / space-between / space-around / flex-start / flex-end;
    align-items: center / baseline;
}

3. To wrap the flex items / children inside a container, then use 

.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-content: flex-start;
    gap: 1em;
}

4. To grow a particular flex item, use flex-grow: 1 property.
flex-grow works based on unitless value as it allows the item to grow in proportion to the rest available space.
It is recommended to use shorthand property as flex: 1. 
Flex: 1 is a combination of flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis.

5. Overwrite alignment of items with respect to the container spec:
For eg: align-items in container is set to center. But if need to overwrite the first item position to center then
align-self: center works.

6. Change the order in which the item appears.
order: 1 / -1;
