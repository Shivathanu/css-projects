1. To avoid content from hidden in the bottom where it is greater than the viewport, use small viewport unit inplace of viewport. For eg:

body {
    height: svh;
}

2. In order to make font sizes fluid, do not use viewport units on font-size property, as that will violate the rules of zoom in browser or os level.
Instead set a minimum bound and maximum bound value to clamp function and set to the font size property.

body {
    font-size: clamp(3rem, 5vw + 1rem,6rem);
}
