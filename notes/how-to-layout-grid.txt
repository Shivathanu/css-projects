Tailwind layout (https://tailwindcss.com/)

Below exercise can be tried out online in https://play.tailwindcss.com/.

In tailwind to add responsiveness, always target the breakpoints above small screens, and leave default property to have on mobile.
So here it is not mobile first development approach, but instead web screen is targeted.

1. How to layout any page using grid with tailwindcss?.

Solution: Visualize how many blocks are required to display on the page. If there are three section then it is required to have three 
grid items. Please note by default the grid items are displayed on column wise unless specified to show in row by grid-cols-[number of rows].

* For Eg: Using above grid-cols-2 translates in css to grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr));

Lets say we need to display three sections as with typical left sidebar, main content, right sidebar.

```
<div class="m-4 grid gap-4">
    <div class="min-h-[100px] rounded-lg bg-orange-500 shadow"></div>
    <div class="min-h-[100px] rounded-lg bg-teal-500 shadow"></div>
    <div class="min-h-[100px] rounded-lg bg-purple-500 shadow"></div>
</div>
```

2. How to show above three div blocks in row wise as we see in browser web screen. In mobile should be default. 

Hint: Grid layout by default has 12 columns. 

We need to distribute the grid items to span the available column spaces to required, and fill the page.

```
<div class="m-4 grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 sm:grid-cols-12">
  <div class="hidden min-h-[100px] rounded-lg bg-orange-500 shadow sm:col-span-2 sm:block"></div>
  <div class="min-h-[100px] rounded-lg bg-red-500 shadow sm:col-span-8"></div>
  <div class="hidden min-h-[100px] rounded-lg bg-teal-500 shadow sm:col-span-2 sm:block"></div>
</div>
```
